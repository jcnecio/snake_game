# Just a snake game in python
Developed using python 3.8.6

## Dependencies
### I used these version in developing this game, lower version may still work


* pygame==2.0.0.dev12
* numpy==1.18.5

## Running
```bash
python snake.py
```

## Running the genetic algorithm
```bash
python simulation_runner.py
```
I didn't add a run specific generation part into the simulation runner, I usualy uncomment the part above the training part and comment the training code
